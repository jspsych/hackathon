                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    We're excited to announce our second hackathon dedicated to
                    extending the jsPsych ecosystem! This two-week event will provide
                    hands on training in contributing to open source software and
                    building custom plugins for jsPsych. Participants will work in small
                    teams to develop new plugins and extensions, with guidance from the
                    jsPsych development team.

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    This event is aimed at researchers who have experience with using
                    jsPsych for building experiments. We won't be teaching the basics of
                    how to use jsPsych at this event. Instead, we will be focusing on
                    how to develop and extend jsPsych itself. If you're interested in
                    learning how to build your own plugins, or you want to learn how to
                    contribute your work to the jsPsych ecosystem, this event is for you!
                    <br><br>
                    This is also an especially accessible opportunity for anyone who would
                    otherwise be unable to travel for an in-person event.
