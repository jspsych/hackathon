                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    We're excited to announce our second hackathon dedicated to
                    extending the jsPsych ecosystem! This two-week event will provide
                    hands on training in contributing to open source software and
                    building custom plugins for jsPsych.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    Participants will work in small teams to develop new plugins, 
                    extensions, or timelines with guidance from the jsPsych development 
                    team. A new <strong>plugin</strong> can make a new type of trial 
                    available for researchers, like a drag and drop word bank. A new 
                    <strong>extension</strong> can add new functionality across multiple 
                    trials and even additional data types, like eye tracking or fitbit 
                    metrics. A new <strong>timeline</strong> is a way to share a parameterized 
                    version of an entire task. For example, a Stroop task with customizable 
                    words, colors, stimulus timing, and responses.
                </p></br>
                <p>
                    We will also offer hands-on support for building experiments, and help 
                    teams think about how to convert experiments into shareable, parameterized 
                    timelines.

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    This event is aimed at researchers who have experience with using
                    jsPsych for building experiments. We won't be teaching the basics of
                    how to use jsPsych at this event. Instead, we will be focusing on
                    how to develop and extend jsPsych itself. If you're interested in
                    learning how to build your own plugins, or you want to learn how to
                    contribute your work to the jsPsych ecosystem, this event is for you!
                    <br><br>
                    This is also an especially accessible opportunity for anyone who would
                    otherwise be unable to travel for an in-person event.
